<br>
For this assignment you will  be building upon an implementation a singly linked list. A skeletal implementation of a singly linked list is provided as a starting point for the assignment. It was derived from code taken from the text, “Starting out with Java: from control structures through data structures”, 3rd edition, Tony Gaddis and Godfrey Muganda.

<h2>The Modi cations</h2>

Add the following methods to LinkedList:

Do NOT put a “public static void main()” in LinkedList.java. Include an additional file in your project that contains method main. Include enough tests in method main() to demonstrate that all the requirements of the assignment have been met.

<h3>Hint</h3>

The intersect and union methods are set operations. Recall that a set does not have duplicates. The lists that result from the computations should contain no duplicates.

<h3>Extra Credit</h3>

Extra credit will be given to solutions that are the most efficient with respect to execution time and memory usage. However, in order for a submission to be considered for extra credit, all of the requirements of the assignment must be met.
